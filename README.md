#My very first website

"My family" is a site created by a mother as a gift to her children.

It's a good idea to keep the memories of a family in today's world where memories are forgotten over time and photos can be easily lost.

The users of this site are primarily children who own the memories on the site. The target audience of the site is planned to be developed as family, relatives, friends and more.
